About:
-------
Battmon is simple battery monitoring program written in python,
especially for tiling window managers like xmonad, dwm or awesome.

Features:
----------
- very light (for really basic functionality you need only python installed)
- works in background
- configurable
- no tray icon
- pop-up notifications
- options can be given through the command line (see battmon --help for details)

Prerequisites:
---------------
- python for basic functionality (python3 and python2.7+ are supported)
- setproctitle: module to set program name,
  thus works killall Battmon under python2 and python3,
  (in my opinion this is preferred way to set process name, but anyway it's optional)
- libnotify: for pop up notifications
- sox: for playing sounds
- i3lock: to lock user session before hibernating/suspending
- pm-utils/upower: for hibernate, suspend or shutdown system on critical battery level
  (when both installed, upower will be used as default)

Usage:
-------
- Make battmon executable:
	chmod +x ./battmon.py
  and run: ./battmon.py

- or just run:
    python ./battmon.py
  ff you have any problems with above command, try:
    'python<YOUR PYTHON VERSION> ./battmon.py'

- To see all available options run Battmon with `-h` or `--help` option.
    python ./battmon.py -h

Notes:
-------
- If you want to use hibernate, suspend or shutdown with upower,
  be sure that your ck-list-sessions output gives you something like this:

	$: ck-list-sessions
   	...
   	active = TRUE
   	...
   	is-local = TRUE
   	...
- If you don't use *KIT soft, then be sure,
  that you can execute `pm-suspend`, `pm-hibernate` and `shutdown` with root privileges.

- If you want change default screenlock command, edit `DEFAULT_SCREEN_LOCK_COMMAND` variable in `battmon.py`
  or change it by parsing your screenlock command througth `-lp` argument in command line,
  when you use this argument remember to surround whole your screenlock command with quotes.

- Sound file is search by default in the same path where battmon was started,
  you can change this by parsing your path to your sound file using `-sp` argument without quotes.

- If you don't use *KIT soft, then be sure,
  that you can execute `pm-suspend`, `pm-hibernate` and `shutdown` with root privileges.
