About:
-------
Battmon is simple battery monitoring program written in python,
especially for tiling window managers like xmonad, dwm or awesome.

Features:
----------
- very light (for really basic functionality you need only python installed)
- works in background
- configurable
- no tray icon
- pop-up notifications
- options can be given through the command line (see battmon --help for details)

Prerequisites:
---------------
- only python for basic functionality
  (>=3.2 and >=2.7 are supported,
  if you have another python version, install argparse from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse)
- libnotify: for pop up notifications
- sox: for playing sounds
- i3lock: to lock user session before hibernating/suspending
- pm-utils/upower: for hibernate, suspend or shutdown system on critical battery level
  (when both installed, upower will be used as default)

Usage:
-------
- Make battmon executable:
	chmod +x ./battmon.py
  and run: ./battmon.py

- or just run:
    python ./battmon.py
  ff you have any problems with above command, try:
    'python<YOUR PYTHON VERSION> ./battmon.py'

- To see all available options run Battmon with `-h` or `--help` option.
    python ./battmon.py -h

Notes:
-------
- files in `bin` will be used when no upower or pm-utils are installed, thus it's will be able to hibernate,
  suspend or shutdown the system, so be sure, that you can execute them with root privileges

- If you want to use hibernate, suspend or shutdown with upower,
  be sure that your ck-list-sessions output gives you something like this:
	$: ck-list-sessions
   	...
   	active = TRUE
   	...
   	is-local = TRUE
   	...

- If you don't use *KIT soft and have `pm-suspend`, `pm-hibernate` and `shutdown` installed,
  you with root privileges.

- If you don"t have installed `pm-utils`, be sure, that you can execute:
    $: echo mem > /sys/power/state
    and
    $: echo disk > /sys/power/state
    as regular user

- `DEFAULT_SCREEN_LOCK_COMMANDS` is the list of lockscreen commands, first found will be used as default.
  To set your default one, just add your favor command at the beginning of the list
  or change it by parsing your screenlock command througth `-lp` argument in command line,
  when you use this argument remember to surround whole your screenlock command with quotes.

- Sound file is search by default in the same path where battmon was started,
  you can change this by parsing your path to your sound file using `-sp` argument
  without quotes.
